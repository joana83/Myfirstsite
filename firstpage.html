       <h3>Management Style</h3>
       <p>Jobs was perceived as a demanding perfectionist, who always aspired
       to position his businesses and their products at the forefront of the
       information technology industry, by foreseeing and setting innovation
       and style trends. He was aggressive with a demanding personality.Jobs
       had a public war of words with Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell, starting
       in 1987, when Jobs first criticized Dell for making "un-innovative beige
       boxes". On October 6, 1997, at a Gartner Symposium, when Dell was asked
       what he would do if he ran the then-troubled Apple Computer company, he
       said: "I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.
       Apple's third co-founder Wayne explained that Job's personality was very
       cold. He recounted the times Jobs was ruthless, including one occasion
       in which Jobs asked Wayne to convince a friend to sell his company for
       Apple's benefit. Apple's Bud Tribble coined the term "reality distortion
       field" (RDF) in 1981, to describe Jobs's charisma and its effects on the
       developers working on the Macintosh project.
       </p>

       <h3>Wealth</h3>
       <p>Although Jobs earned only $1 a year as CEO of Apple, Jobs held 5.426
       million Apple shares worth $2.1 billion, as well as 138 million shares
       in Disney (which he received in exchange for Disney's acquisition of
       Pixar) worth $4.4 billion. Jobs quipped that the $1 per annum he was
       paid by Apple was based on attending one meeting for 50 cents while the
       other 50 cents was based on his performance.[124] Forbes estimated his
       net wealth at $8.3 billion in 2010, making him the 42nd-wealthiest
       American.
       </p>

       <h3>Innovation & Design</h3>
       <p>Jobs's design aesthetic was influenced by the modernist architectural
       style of Joseph Eichler and the industrial designs of Braun's Dieter
       Rams. His design sense was also greatly influenced by the Buddhism which
       he experienced in India while on his seven-month spiritual journey, and
       his sense of intuition was influenced by the spiritual people with whom
       he studied.</p>
       
       <p>According to Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak "Steve didn't ever code.
       He wasn't an engineer and he didn't do any original design..." Daniel
       Kottke, one of Apple's earliest employees and a college friend of
       Jobs's, stated that "Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the
       inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing person. Even thought he was not
       such a great designer Jobs helped promote the Macintosh computer, the
       NeXt computer, the IMac, IPod and IPhone.Apple iMac was introduced in
       1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return
       to Apple. Apple boasted "the back of our computer looks better than the
       front of anyone else's". Just as Steve Jobs instigated Apple's success
       in the 1970s, he is credited with revitalizing the company in the 1990s.
       With a new management team, altered stock options and a self-imposed
       annual salary of $1 a year, Jobs put Apple back on track. His ingenious
       produ cts such as the iMac, effective branding campaigns and stylish
       designs caught the attention of c onsumers once again.</p>

       <p>In 2008, iTunes became the second-biggest music retailer in
       America-second only to Wal-Mart. Half of Apple's current revenue comes
       from iTunes and iPod sales, with 200 million iPods sold and 6 billion
       songs downloaded. For these reasons, Apple has been ranked No. 1 on
       Fortune magazine's list of "America's Most Admired Companies," as well
       as No. 1 among Fortune 500 companies for returns to shareholders.
       </p>
	 
       <h3>Philantropy</h3>
       <p>In contrast to Gates, Jobs did not sign the Giving Pledge of Warren
       Buffett which challenged the world's richest billionaires to give at
       least half their wealth to charity. After resuming control of Apple in
       1997, Jobs initially eliminated all corporate philanthropy
       programs.Later, under Jobs, Apple signed to participate in the Product
       Red program, producing red versions of devices to give profits from
       sales to charity. Apple has gone on to become the largest contributor to
       the charity since its initial involvement with it.</p>

     <p>Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have a faith in
     people, that they're basically good and smart, and if you give them tools,
     they'll do wonderful things with them. Steve Jobs</p>
